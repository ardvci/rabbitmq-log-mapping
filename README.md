# Scala Producer-Consumer Application Deployment with Kubernetes and Helm Charts

Welcome to our cutting-edge Scala producer-consumer application deployment guide! In this repository, we provide a comprehensive solution for building and deploying a high-performance producer-consumer application using Scala, Kubernetes, and Helm charts.

## Overview

This project showcases the development and deployment of a producer-consumer application in Scala, designed to efficiently handle asynchronous tasks and manage data streams. Leveraging the power of Scala's functional programming capabilities, we've crafted a robust and scalable solution that's both elegant and performant.

## Features

- **Scala Implementation**: Harness the power of Scala's expressive syntax and functional programming paradigms to build resilient and efficient producer-consumer workflows.
- **Kubernetes Deployment**: Seamlessly deploy your Scala application to Kubernetes clusters for scalable and resilient operation in cloud-native environments.
- **Helm Charts**: Simplify the packaging and deployment of your Scala application with Helm charts, enabling easy versioning, templating, and management of Kubernetes resources.
- **Containerization**: Utilize Docker containers to encapsulate your Scala application, ensuring consistency and portability across different deployment environments.
- **Monitoring and Scalability**: Leverage Kubernetes' monitoring and autoscaling capabilities to dynamically scale your Scala application based on resource utilization and traffic patterns.

## Getting Started

To get started with deploying your Scala producer-consumer application to Kubernetes using Helm charts, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Build the producer & consumer dockerfiles and push it as your local repository using `docker build -f producer.Dockerfile -t log-agg-producer .` & `docker build -f consumer.Dockerfile -t log-agg-consumer .`
3. Navigate to the `log-mapping-helm` directory and customize the Helm chart values to match your application configuration.
4. Install Helm and set up a Kubernetes cluster if you haven't already.
5. Run `helm install` with the customized Helm chart to deploy your Scala application to Kubernetes.
6. Monitor and manage your deployed application using Kubernetes tools and utilities.
